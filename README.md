# CMSProject

Custom built CMS that uses a pre-designed template with a focus on posting blog posts and recipes. In this project the 'sql' folder contains the scripts needed for the MySQL database while all the code is available in the 'blog' folder. Files in the 'blog/templates/unused' folder are parts that have been sectioned off of the pre-designed template for either later use or development.
